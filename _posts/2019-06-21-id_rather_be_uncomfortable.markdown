It’s been over a year since I was last in school. Not a big deal, but at the time, I, honestly, thought that it would be the last time I’d be in school. I was content with my associate’s degree in Computer Programming. I was content with my new position as a WordPress Web Developer for a multi-million dollar digital marketing company. I was content with how my personal- and work-life was going, so I let myself get comfortable.

The first six months of my new position went by in a snap. I was learning everyday, the clientele (along with my workload) was increasing every week, and I happily took on more responsibilities like managing the Post-Live Department and training new-hire devs. I even got myself a nice raise somewhere along the way!

As time went on, I couldn’t help but start to feel restless. I had gotten into the groove of everything and created a monotonous routine for myself. Although I was meeting the never-ending deadlines and took on multiple projects, I felt… numb? Many times, I would find myself doing the work, but my mind wasn’t fully present — I wasn’t as excited as I used to be. I was stuck, and I knew something had to change.

I started to reflect on what I really wanted to do with my career and how I can get that “spark” back. I was also looking for different positions that were possible with the degree I already had and what I needed to do to get there. During this time, I came across several amazing groups like Tech Girls, Women in Tech, Girls Who Code, and Girl Develop It. I was so excited to hear and read about all these amazing women in the tech field, kicking a$$ at what they do and supporting each other along the way. That’s when the thought came to me: I’m already familiar with the front-end, which means I’m half-way there to becoming a Full Stack Dev… I need to keep going!

I finally found the courage to quit my job, and after a lot of researching (and debating with myself), I decided to jump in and take the Online Software Engineering course from Flatiron School.

I can confidently say that my excitement is back. I’m ready for the frustration of code not working. I’m ready for the thrilling moments of finally getting my code to work. I’m ready to break my code, then fix it. I’m ready to learn new things and see old things differently. I’m ready to feel uncomfortable, to keep growing, and to keep going up, up, up!
